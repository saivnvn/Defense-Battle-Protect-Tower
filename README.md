# Defense Battle – Protect Tower

![Defense Battle Logo](./logo.jpg)

**Defense Battle – Protect Tower** reimagines classic tower defense through a minimalist design and a deliberate, high-stakes economy. The game is built around clarity, strategy, and meaningful player decisions — without distractions.

## Why It Deserves to Be Featured

### 🎯 Strategy-First Gameplay
Players defend a single core against advancing Shape Monsters by placing towers along a fixed enemy path. Towers can only be built on unlocked land tiles, turning placement into a core strategic challenge rather than a simple reaction.

### 💰 High-Stakes Economy
Gold is never passive. Income is generated exclusively by **Gold Towers** during active waves. No wave means no income — forcing players to constantly balance survival and long-term growth.

### 🧩 Tactical Terrain Expansion
Progression is not only about power, but space. Unlocking land tiles expands the battlefield and introduces new spatial puzzles, making each area feel distinct and intentional.

### ✨ Clean, Premium Experience
The game features a modern, minimalist UI, smooth camera movement, automatic progress saving, and full **Apple Game Center** leaderboard integration — emphasizing skill and efficiency over luck.

> *Easy to learn. Hard to master.*  
> **Defense Battle – Protect Tower** delivers a focused, skill-based tower defense experience designed for iPhone and iPad.
